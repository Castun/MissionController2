MissionController2 Test Version 1.07
==================

For KSP .25


Version 1.07

1. All time based missions can now be completed without being in the active vessel.  Meaning as long
as the contract is still active the time countdown is also active.  Even in Editor, space center view.

2. The time countdown will now only show for the vessel its attached to.  So switching to another 
vessel the time countdown for that vessel and contract will disapear.  But Number 1 still applies.

3. Added new Satellite contract.  Has different objectives then the other two and also as objective to
add a certain Science Part to the payload.  This part can and will include any mods you have installed
that have parts that are classified as science parts in KSP.

4. Added new Civilian contract Low Kerbin Orbit tour.  This is a new contract type that has you bring
a random number of kerbals to Kerbin orbit for a paid tour.  This new special contract simulates adding
a random number of Civilian Kerbals to your vessel.  On this vessel you have to have open seats for 
them to occupy, if not then you cannot finish the contract.  If at any time you take up the seats with
crew then the objective will be cleared until you open up the seats again.  Please note that the civilians
are simulated and not actually represented in game with Crew.  Sorry I tried to find a way to do this
and have not figured it out yet, or if its even possible.  All civilians have random names.
